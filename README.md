Don't struggle with dependences. Just K-ILP it with fire

### Why?:

I have run into a lot of issues with ILP being updated. To be honest, I'm not sure what dependencies are required for the various activities that I want to do. I made this script becuase I wanted to spend less time thinking about that. This npm installs 30 different interledger js packages globally, configures your moneyd wallet, and starts moneyd. It is definitely overkill, but it works consistently.

### To run:
```
$ bash start.sh
```

### To do:

1. Support cases where .moneyd.json is already present
2. Figure out which dependencies are actually necessary
3. Put all packages into a single npm install statement
4. Maybe handle node dependencies too?
